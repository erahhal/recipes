      - item: blueberries

        unit: pint
      - item: strawberries
        amount: 1.5
        unit: lbs
    steps:
      - Slice strawberries thin lengthwise.  Do this when stacking the cake so you only cut as much as you need.
steps:
  - To stack the cake, first remove the domes from the cakes with a large serrated knife.
  - Then, use a small straw, or something similar, to poke holes in the top of each cake.
  - Place the first layer of cake on your cake plate.
  - Spread half of the strawberry puree over the cake, so that it soaks into the holes.
  - Top cake with a layer of whipped cream. You’ll use about 2 cups of whipped cream per layer.
  - Top the whipped cream with blueberries and sliced strawberries.
  - Repeat with the second layer of cake using the blueberry puree, whipped cream and berries.
  - Top the cake with the last layer of cake, using the other half of the strawberry puree, then spread with remaining whipped cream.
  - Slice remaining strawberries for use on the top of the cake to make the flower.
  - To make the flower, place slices of strawberries around the top edge of the cake, allowing the bottoms of the “petals” to touch. Make three rows of slices, overlapping them.
  - Fill in the center of the flower with blueberries.
  - Refrigerate cake until ready to use. Best if eaten within 2 days of making.
