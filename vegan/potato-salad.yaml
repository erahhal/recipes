steps:
  - Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Place pot on the stove over high heat and cover. Bring to a boil and then lower heat to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are slightly fork tender* and drain. Leave potatoes in the colander and cover with a clean kitchen towel to steam for 15 minutes. Uncover and allow to cool for an additional 15 minutes.
  - While potatoes are cooking, make the dressing. Add mayo, vinegar, mustard, celery, green onions, dill pickle and pepper to a large bowl. Stir to combine, cover and place in the fridge until ready to use.
  - When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut into quarters**. Add potatoes to the dressing and fold them in. Taste and add salt to taste and adjust any seasonings as needed.
  - Place in the fridge until completely cool - at least 1 hour.
  - Serve and enjoy.
