ingredients:
  - item: meatless meatballs
    amount: 12
  - item: pineapple chunks (canned is fine)
    amount: 12
  - item: toothpicks
    amount: 12
steps:
  - Warm a skillet over high heat. Add a drizzle of oil. Add the meatless meatballs to the pan. Cook for about ten minutes, or until cooked through and crispy-browned on the outside. Tip: For faster cooking, thaw/warm in the microwave for a minute before placing in the pan.
  - Transfer the cooked balls to a small bowl to cool off a bit and rest, while you whip up the sauce.
  - Pour the sauce into the meatless meatball bowl. Saturate every ball well so that they soak up the sauce. Allow them to sit a minute or so to fully marinate. The sauce sticks a bit better if your balls have cooled a tiny bit from the pan.
  - Piece a toothpick with a pineapple chunk, then pierce with a ball. Set on your serving plate. Repeat until all the balls and pineapple chunks are plated.
  - Serve right away. Pour the leftover sauce into a small dish for dunking. If making for a party, you may want to make a fresh batch of sauce so you have enough for everyone.
