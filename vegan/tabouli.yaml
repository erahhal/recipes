steps:
  - If bulgur is hard and not fine, may need to first boil and drain it
  - In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil and lemon juice until well combined.
  - Add the bulgur to the dressing and let it soak until it is soft and plumped, about 15 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables by washing, drying thoroughly and finely chopping them.
  - When preparing the tomatoes, it helps to use a colander to drain the excess juice, which you can use in another recipe at a later time.
  - Place the chopped vegetables in a large bowl.
  - Add the optional mint.
  - Season with salt and pepper.
  - Pour the bulgur and dressing mixture over, and gently toss to combine.
  - Serve at room temperature or cold, with lettuce if desired.
