steps:
  - Add rice to a medium sized bowl and water to cover. Let sit for at least 5 hours (preferably overnight).
  - On the day of cooking, drain the rice.
  - Cut pineapple in half lengthwise. Carefully use a knife to carve a few crosses into each half, without piercing the rind.
  - Place pineapple in a bowl. Use a spoon to scoop the pineapple flesh, so the pineapple rind forms the shape of a bowl. Be careful to leave at least 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inches) of flesh on the rind, so the pineapple will hold its shape throughout cooking. Use the bowl to catch the juice that gets squeezed out in the process of hollowing out the pineapple.
  - Drain the pineapple cubes to separate the juice. You will get approximately 1/3 cup juice from one large pineapple.
  - Transfer glutinous rice to a bowl. Add sugar, salt and raisins. Mix well. Add the pineapple juice to the rice and mix again.
  - Stuff the pineapple with rice.
  - Add water to a steamer until the water almost reaches steaming rack. Place a plate on the steaming rack and place the pineapple on top.
  - If your steamer is not large enough to hold the two pieces of pineapple, cook them one at a time.
  - Cover the steamer and bring water to a boil over heat over high heat. Turn to medium low or low heat, to keep the water boiling without evaporating too quickly. Cook covered for 30 minutes.
  - Uncover the steamer. Check the water level and add more if the water is running low. Carefully use a spoon to mix the rice. Place a layer of pineapple cubes on top (you wonâ€™t able to use all the pineapple).
  - Cover the steamer. Bring back to a boil over high heat. Cook over medium low or low heat for another 30 minutes.
  - Transfer the cooked rice to a bowl and gently mix again. Let it cool for a few minutes.
  - Serve warm or at room temperature.
  - If you cook the rice the day before serving, store the rice in an airtight container in the fridge. Use a microwave to warm up the rice before serving, to bring back its sticky texture.
steps_alt:
  - To cook with pre-cut pineapple (in a normal bowl)
  - You will need about 2 and 1/2 cups (500 grams) pineapple cubes.
  - Place 1 and 1/2 cup pineapple cubes in a food processor or blender. Mix until pineapple turns to a paste. Drain the pineapple paste with a fine mesh strainer (or a clean kitchen towel or several layers of cheesecloth). Discard the pineapple fiber and bits. You should generate slightly more than 1/2 cup (150 ml) pineapple juice.
  - Cut the remaining 1 cup pineapple into smaller cubes. Set aside.
  - Mix the rice, salt, sugar, raisins, and pineapple juice in a bowl.
  - Cook the rice in a steamer using the method above.
  - After 30 minutes, stir the rice and add back all the pineapple cubes. Gently mix again and continue to steam for another 30 minutes.
  - Store and serve using the method above.
