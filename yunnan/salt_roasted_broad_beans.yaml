ingredients:
  - item: dried fava beans
    amount: 1
    unit: cup
  - item: salt
    amount: 1
    unit: tsp
    to_taste: true
  - item: olive oil
    amount: 5
    unit: tsp
steps:
  - Soak beans 6-8 hours or overnight.
  - Drain, rinse, cover with cold water.
  - Bring to a boil and boil until the beans pop (something like a corn kernel).  They won’t all open at the same time, so remove when you feel most are ready.
  - Handling the beans gently now, drain and let them cool a little, then toss in the oil and salt and spread on a baking sheet to roast in a 350-degree oven until they are golden brown (around 25-40 min, but check and taste often; you don’t want the center of the bean to still have any moisture after cooling ). Evenness of cooking time may still be a problem and you may have to discard some; pick over before serving.
